## Update server settings
Connecto to server to execute the commands.

## Setup SSL certificate
NOTE: Before using this approach, ensure that you have access to domainâ€™s DNS configuration through your DNS provider.

### Configuring a static IP Address
Google Cloud Platform instances are launched with a dynamic IP address by default, which means that the IP address changes every time the server is stopped and restarted. In many cases, this is not desired and so, users also have the option to assign the server a static IP address.

### Update DNS record
Create a record in your DNS provider, to point to the IP address set in the previous step.

### Enable SSL access over HTTPS with with letsencrypt
Log into the server and execute the following command changing the domain you want to use
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com
```
After that update the settings on the nginx configuration
```bash
