- Not sure if it is in our best practices, but Franklin and I both agreed that regexes should be used sparingly. There also should be no colon after the intent name if there is no test
- skill-testing.json should be on the root of the project
- And with regard to laying out the tests, I think the way you have done it there is good. I like unit and e2e folders. I think we could even make that our best practice recommendation. For cases where people have both. ITS BETTER IN THAT CASE TO HAVE ONE skill-testing.json with 2 sections, one for unit, other for e2e as talked with Ken.
- locales folder: It shouldn't be under root. If we do both e2e and unit in one project, it should maybe be shared under test. So the test folder would be e2e, unit and locales. But I don't ever see it being under root - it's wholly part of testing, and we don't want it to be confused with other localization pieced that may be part of the project.
- I made recommendations on this in best practices, but did not suggest this - could be a good addition if we like it. I think it means the locales directory should be searched for And configurable So it looks at current dir/locales But also checks test/locales. Alternatively, it can be just set as localesDir parameter Not a high priority change though in my mind :-)
