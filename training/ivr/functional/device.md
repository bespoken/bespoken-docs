## Overview
To get started with testing, the first step is to create a virtual device. This allows us to interact via voice, chat, Alexa, etc. Our virtual devices enable our tests to communicate with the application we want to test.

## Walkthrough
These are the steps:
* Click on the "Virtual Devices" icon the left-hand side (second from the top)
* Click "Add Virtual Device"
* Select "Phone Virtual Device"
* Select "Ok"
