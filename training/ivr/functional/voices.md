# Text-To-Speech Voices
## Overview
Automated testing for IVR relies upon generating audio to talk with the phone system we are testing.

By default, we use the Watson `en-US_MichaelV2Voice`. We also offer a broad selection of other voices from:
* Amazon Polly
* Google TTS
* Watson TTS

Additionally, when the Locale field is changed, the choices for voice testing will be updated.

## Changing Voices
To change the voice being used, simply pick a different one from the voice drop-down.

## Using Recorded Audio
Alternatively, to use recorded audio for a test, simply insert a URL to an audio file into the "Input" field.

That will be used instead of Text-To-Speech.
