It allows you to evaluate a few of the major ASR providers on the market.

## The ROI On Accuracy Testing  
We provide our in-depth Accuracy ROI calculator on our blog. Even for moderate call volumes, the savings can be immense by improving how well users are understood:

## Going Deeper
To setup an in-depth accuracy test for your IVR, we need a few parameters to configure it:
* Type of model being evaluated (ASR, NLU, transcription, intent classification)
* Current platform/platforms being utilized
* Languages and accents being tested
* Common environments in which users are interacting with the system (in-car, on-the-go, at-home, etc.)
* Phrases and intents that are considered problematic
