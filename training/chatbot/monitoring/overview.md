## Create Functional Tests
Follow our guide to create functional tests first that will be used for monitoring:  
[Bespoken Training - Chatbot Functional Testing](/training/chatbot/functional/overview.md)

## Enable Monitoring
Once your functional test is setup, simply select the "Monitoring" toggle on the top-right to start running tests routinely.

When toggled, you will be asked to choose the frequency with which you want to run tests. Select the appropriate cadence, and you will be off and running.

## Reporting
By selecting the "Monitoring" icon on the left-hand side, we can see the history of our monitoring over time:
