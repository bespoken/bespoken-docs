# Load Testing
## Create Functional Tests
Follow our guide to create functional tests first that will be used for load testing:  
[Bespoken Training - Chatbot Functional Testing](/training/chatbot/functional/overview.md)

## Coordinate with Bespoken
To setup a functional test, we need a few parameters to configure it:
* Number of concurrent calls/interactions
* Types of interactions (IVR, Chatbot, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.)
* Approximate duration of each call
* Duration of the test
* Number of simulated agents [Optional]

Send an email to [support@bespoken.io](mailto:support@bespoken.io) with this information, and we will have it setup for you in no time.
