# Bespoken Release Roundup - April 2020

## [Dashboard](https://apps.bespoken.io)

### New features and improvements
- **Multiple tests support**: It is now possible to add and run multiple tests on each of your voice app's test page. This is a huge accomplishment for us since it aligns our test UI (Dashboard) with the capabilities of our CLI, and will be the foundation for many good things to come in the future. I'll share more details on a coming blog post but, for now, take a quick look at how it works below and go try it for yourself!

### Bug fixes
- Subscribed enterprise users can now see last month's quota usage on their Billing page.
- The Monitoring History page is now displaying voice apps that are waiting for their first monitoring results.

## Virtual Device

### New features and improvements

- **RAW data response**: By default, all virtual device responses now include a "raw" property, where you'll be able to find all the information that came back from your voice platform in raw form. This was previously only accessible if you set the "debug" property to `true` in your request.
- **Audio payload support**: Our virtual device endpoints now support receiving audios from a URL as an alternative to text or a base64 string. You can read more about how to send your own audios using the virtual device HTTP API (here)[https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/api/#http-api].

## [Bespoken CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bespoken-tools)
### New features and improvements
- **Improved messaging**: The following cases have had their messages updated for clarity:
  - Missing testing.json file ((skill-testing-ml#343)[https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/343])
  - Errors happening within a filter. ((skill-testing-ml#343)[https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/344])
  - Create your first Virtual Device token URL ((bst#639)[https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/639])
- **stopTestOnFailure for Twilio**: setting the `stopTestOnFailure` property to true now works with Twilio Virtual Devices too. The property will finish a test as soon as one assertion fails. 


### Bug fixes
 - When all tests are skipped, the test reports will mark the test suite as Passed instead of Failure. ((bst#638)[https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/638])


## Others
### Docs additions:
- Added docs on how to use our E2E tests with IVR systems. You can read a lot more about it (here)[https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/ivr/]!
