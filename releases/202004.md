# Bespoken Release Roundup - April 2020

## [Dashboard](https://apps.bespoken.io)

### New features and improvements
- **Multiple tests support**: The Dashboard Test page now supports adding multiple tests per Voice App. This is huge for us, as it aligns the Dashboard much more with our CLI and will be the foundation of many good things to come. I'll explain more on a coming blog post but, for now, take a quick look at how it works here:

### Bug fixes
- Changes have been made so that subscribed users can see their quota usage for the last month correctly on the Billing page.
- The monitoring history page now shows voice apps that are waiting for its first monitoring result accordingly.

## Virtual Device

### New features and improvements

- **RAW data response**: By default, all virtual device responses now include a "raw" property, where you'll be able to find all the information that came back from your voice platform in raw form. This was previously only accessible if you set the "debug" property to `true` in your request.
- **Audio payload support**: Our virtual device endpoints now support receiving audios from a URL as an alternative to text or a base64 string. You can read more about how to send your own audios using the virtual device HTTP API (here)[https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/api/#http-api].

## [Bespoken CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bespoken-tools)
### New features and improvements
- **Improved messaging**: The following cases have had their messages updated for clarity:
  - Missing testing.json file ((skill-testing-ml#343)[https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/343])
  - Errors happening within a filter. ((skill-testing-ml#343)[https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/344])
  - Create your first Virtual Device token URL ((bst#639)[https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/639])
- **stopTestOnFailure for Twilio**: setting the `stopTestOnFailure` property to true now works with Twilio Virtual Devices too. The property will finish a test as soon as one assertion fails. 


### Bug fixes
 - When all tests are skipped, the test reports will mark the test suite as Passed instead of Failure. ((bst#638)[https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/638])


## Others
### Docs additions:
- Added docs on how to use our E2E tests with IVR systems. You can read a lot more about it (here)[https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/ivr/]!
