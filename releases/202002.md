# Bespoken Release Roundup - February 2020
We haven't stopped working hard for you in this 2020 and to prove it here's the latest features, improvements and bug fixes that were released during this month.

## [Dashboard](https://apps.bespoken.io)
### New Features and Improvements
- **Advanced Test Settings**: By clicking on the gear icon on the test page, you can now adjust the execution of your tests using the configuration described [here](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/guide/#configuration). This includes homophones, timeouts and others. Be aware that key settings like the virtual device, locales and voices will keep using the ones selected on the dropdowns. 

- **Twilio support on Dashboard**: Our IVR users will be happy to know that you can now create Virtual Devices for Twilio and create tests for it too. For now, this feature will be activated by request so, if you are interested in creating these kinds of tests just get in touch with us!

- **Autocomplete behavior on assertions has been fixed**: When creating a test you have shorthands available like prompt (default), cardContent and cardTitle. However, some of these shorthands were not easily available because of an issue that was present until now. Give it a try! and remember, you can also type in JSONPath expressions too!

- **Download a test has been updated**: Download a test from Dashboard and you'll see now your advanced settings in its own testing.json file. Also, the voiceId has been included inside the test file.

### Bug fixing and improvements
- Fixed an issue where the pie chart inside the weekly monitoring review email would not appear.
- Fixed an issue where virtual devices would not appear updated/deleted in the Virtual Device Manager until the user refreshed the page.

## [Bespoken CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bespoken-tools)

### New Features and Improvements
- **User profile mock**: You can now mock the User Profile Service API in your unit tests for Alexa. Read more about it [here](https://read.bespoken.io/unit-testing/use-cases/#testing-with-the-user-profile-service-api).
- **BST init update**: While running the bst init command, our `testing.json` file is saved on the folder from which the command was run. You can put it anywhere else if you want, just remember to call bst test and specifying the file location by using the `--config` option. Read more about the bst init command [here](https://read.bespoken.io/cli/commands/#init) and more about the config option [here](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/guide/#custom-configuration-path).
- **Improved error messaging**: When facing an unknown exception, bst would usually reply with messages saying `Error description missing`, `Cannot read property 'message' of undefined` and so on. We've been working actively to make those messages clearer so that you can know exactly the reason why they happened.
- **HTML Report on a single file**: Users of unit and end to end testing can now generate HTML reports of their test runs in a single file with styles and scripts embedded in it. This is helpful if you want to share your report with others. To do this, just set the following environment variable: `JEST_STARE_INLINE_SOURCE=true`. After running your tests, search for the `index.inline.html` file in your `test_output/report` folder.
- **Support for env files**: BST supports the usage of `.env` files now. This is helpful for Jest Stare settings like the one described above and more.

### Bug fixing
- Fixed a bug in which our card shorthand properties were not being filled correctly for Google actions. 

## Others
- **FFMpeg as a service**: We've launched a web service in which you can process your audios with ffmpeg online. If you are interested in getting to know more about it, just reach out to us.
- **Docs additions**: 
  - On your [e2e configuration](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/guide/#configuration) you can mark your tests as skipped instead of failures if they failed because of external reasons by using the `ignoreExternalErrors` property set to `true`.
  - Did you know that you can send utterances without assertions? Read more about it for [unit testing](https://read.bespoken.io/unit-testing/guide/#empty-assertions) or [end to end testing](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/guide/#assertions).
  - How can I test voice apps that are published in a region different than my own? Find out [here](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/faq/#i-ve-changed-my-locale-to-en-uk-however-i-can-t-access-a-voice-app-from-that-region).
  - We've added links to our skill-testing-ml classes in our [filtering section](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/guide/#filtering-during-test) so that it's easier to understand how to create a filter while testing.
