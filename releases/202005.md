# Bespoken Release Roundup - May 2020

## [Dashboard](https://apps.bespoken.io)

### New features and improvements
- **Insert a utterance**: To make your test writing easier, you can now insert utterances in between others by clicking on the "+" symbol as shown below. No need to remove or edit other utterances to fix assertions at the middle of a test!

- **Reorder your utterances**: In the same vein as the previous feature, you can now reorder your utterances easily by clicking on the two arrows at the right of your utterance and simply dragging and dropping your utterances where they belong. Easy right?

### Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue that would prevent users from downgrading to a single-platform plan to from a cross-platform one.

## Virtual Device

### New features and improvements
- **Alexa Presentation Language (APL) support**: Our Alexa virtual devices responses include APL directives now. This means that you can run assertions against your display information and other useful directives at a much deeper level than before. You can access all your skill directives under the `raw.messageBody.directive` path in your assertions.



## [Bespoken CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bespoken-tools)
### New features and improvements
- **HTTPS Proxy support**: You can now use our tools through an https proxy by setting an environment variable like this `HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy-url>:<proxy-port>`. (bst#602)[https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/602]

- **Environment file path**: By using the `--env [filepath]` option, you can specify the location of the .env file you want bst to use. Example: `bst test myTest.e2e.yml --env tests.env`. (bst#637)[https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/637]
