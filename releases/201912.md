# Bespoken Release Roundup - December 2019
Hi! This is Diego Martin, I'm the Product Manager at Bespoken and, as part of our efforts to improve, I'll be sharing with you the latest news regarding our products every month. This will include new features as well as bugs that have been solved.

- **Revamped Subscription process and Billing page:** There's a new icon at the left of your Dashboard that will let you subscribe to one of our paid plans faster and more easily than ever. If you are an already subscribed user, you can use the same page to see stats on your account usage, update your plan or your credit card info (previously under "My account").

### Bug resolution
- Fixed an issue where the syntax check on the YAML test editor would fail and could delete the script if switching to the UI test editor.
- Fixed an issue where syntax errors on monitored YAML tests were not being notified via email.
- Fixed an issue where monitored empty YAML tests were not notified to the user as errors.
- Fixed an issue where tokens with revoked permissions would not notify the users by email if used for monitoring. 

## [Bespoken CLI]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/bespoken-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bespoken-tools))
### New Features:
- **BST init:** With this new command, it's easier than ever to get started on testing with Bespoken. Either if you are looking for unit or end to end testing, the command will ask you some questions that, once filled, will generate for you your first test file and folder structure. It's a great starting point! Read more about it [here](https://read.bespoken.io/cli/commands/#init).

### Bug resolution:
- Variable resolution was not working when using localized tests. ([skill-testing-ml #307](https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/307))
- The test syntax checker didn't recognize an error when there were two hyphens at the start of a test ([skill-testing-ml #313](https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/313))
- The test syntax checker didn't recognize an error when there was no space after a hyphen([skill-testing-ml #308](https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/308))
- Unit tests for Alexa would stop if the interaction models included catalogs ([skill-testing-ml #320](https://github.com/bespoken/skill-testing-ml/issues/320))
- The command `bst speak` now works with more locales besides en-US ([bst #614](https://github.com/bespoken/bst/issues/614))

## Virtual Devices
### Bug fixing
- Fixed an intermittent connection error with the message "Flow control window shrunk below 0".
- There was an unusual amount of errors with the message "Error in response from AVS". This is a custom alert that we sent when there have been issues communicating with Alexa. We have taken the steps necessary to reduce the number of these errors happening.
